# Creating a HTTP server in C++



**Our server had to be very robust, **

The C++ piscine started off as sweet relief and finished a real endurance test.

After so many heavy projects in C, it was super satisfying to learn how to code in a more flexible, free (ciao norminette :wave:) and efficient way. Hopefully I'll never again have to loop round every character to allocate memory. The headlines are: classes, inheritence, pure virtual functions and abstract classes, exceptions, try-catch, switch-case, templates and containers, with a sprinkling of pointers, references, maths and algorithms.
