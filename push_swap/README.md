# Sorting numbers in stacks using an optimised sorting alorithm.

Not quite as painful as the so long project. Hit burnout but that wasn't push swap's fault.


I've learnt my lesson and keep my memory management suuuuuper clean from the start now. And this project is well suited to using linked lists (unlike stocking / parsing my so long map) so ca fait plaisir. Finally getting into the swing of them.


Once you've chosen your algorithm, stocking and sorting the numbers is only the first part of the challenge. The main goal is to do it in as few moves as possible, exploiting double rotates and minimising pushes where possible.


Lots of algorithm possibilites for this project- I put my own spin on [this one](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97) with help from [oceano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaG81sDEpVk) and [thuggonaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRvipSG4Mmk).


Enjoyed using the visualizer... really took me until the end of my project when I couldn't figure out why optimisations weren't working to understand this tool. Very satisfying to play with if you're a visual learner like me.
