# Creating my very own UNIX shell with my mate [KhaSmiley](https://github.com/KhaSmiley).

Minishell's reputation precedes it and I completely get why- this project was a huge test of my coding ability- especially for fixing leaks and debugging- but also my patience, motivation and ability to work as a team. Fortunately I have a pretty great mate and we managed to add some fun and pizzazz to this long and pretty dry project.

A lot of research to do before starting to get to grips with how bash really works and the order in which to structure this project.
[This manual](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dining-philosophers-problem/) is an essential as it details bash's command language syntax in order.
Here are some useful tools to play with: [bash parser](https://vorpaljs.github.io/bash-parser-playground/); [command interpreter](https://explainshell.com/).
The best thing is to test everything you do against bash --posix, you can use the terminator to help.

Otherwise the project felt like a long and painful culmination of everything I've learned at 42 so far- except when you piece together lots of small projects you thought you understood, suddenly nothing works at all :upside_down_face:
And as is often the case, we had the blackhole on our backs too- 42 forcing us to step up or get out...

**Tips:**
- FIND A GR8 M8.
- Being at 42 with your mate as much as possible is a huge time saver, find someone with the same level of motivation and presence at 42- the rest you can learn!
- Get organised- we had a google drive with our plans, tests and resources ++ a shared git with 4 branches (a good moment to get good at git too- Git Kraken saved us multiple times- turns out merge, fastforward and rebase are not to be mixed up).
- Lots of people divide the project into parsing and exec with one person doing each part- we found this reductive and a bit boring as we'd never understand the project as a whole and wouldn't be able to easily debug / fix leaks stemming from the other person's code. Bref, I'm very happy we didn't divide it up like this it saved us time and I'm pleased I understand the whole project. AND this made the microshell exam afterwards feel like a piece of cake :)
- Try not to burnout and take a GOOD OLD REST afterwards, you've earnt it.

Minihell is over- we moving up in the world :nerd_face:
