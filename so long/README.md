# A small 2D game using the MiniLibx library.
## Thanks to [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-sprites) for the free sprites. Thanks to amben-ha for keeping me sane.
Don't be fooled by it's cute pacman-esque exterior, this project is about 20% annoying downloading / optimised makefiling, 10% coding, and 70% parsing, debugging and restructuring.
Or it was for me, anyway.

Definitely feeling the fatigue of finally being thrown into the reality of coding culture rather than tiptoeing round the edges.
- I watched the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy and now finally get all the chat about towels and dolphins.
- I unlocked a new level of debugging thanks to some pals' lldb tips.
- I discovered new valgrind comands and the joys of funchecking your mallocs. (check ur gnl)
- I even recoded my 2D game on scratch to use in one of my kids coding workshops. Accidentally becoming crazy bee lady.
And everything took me 128537 times longer than I thought it would.
But at least it looks cute.
