# Recoding basic C functions

The first few months of 42 were spent getting into the swing of things by recoding my own library of functions (libft), the printf function, and a homemade readline function (get_next_line).

Creating my libft (and getting all my functions to pass three different testers) was long and tedious but ultimately gives a very good foundation for the rest of the curriculum where I'll use my own functions rather than the originals (so best that they're clean).
I enjoyed recoding printf and understanding how to use variadic arguments. And get_next_line was a bit tricky, especially since I decided to use linked lists for the first time. Another good learning curb!
