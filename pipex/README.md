# Recreating the functionality of pipe

Learnt a lot during this project! Very cool to start understanding how to use functions like fork, pipe, exec, dup2 and access. Seeing write() and read() in a completely new light now. Got a bit lost during the bonus' with the multipipe redirections, but in the end the idea of juggling 3 fd's with 1 temp variable helped me better understand the importance of open() and close() and visualise how information is passed through the pipes.

Would recommend starting with the short, helpful videos from the playlist [_Unix Processes in C_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cex9XrZCU14&list=PLfqABt5AS4FkW5mOn2Tn9ZZLLDwA3kZUY) by CodeVault to understand and play with the new concepts.

Later on, the frequently encountered questions at the end of [this article](https://csnotes.medium.com/pipex-tutorial-42-project-4469f5dd5901) are very useful for debugging.
