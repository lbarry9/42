# 42
A collection of projects from my _école 42_ curriculum. Rentrée 05/2023.
We survived the _piscine_, now la vraie aventure commence. Let's see how long it takes me to get through the infamous _common core_...

So far, I've said so long to:
- my libft library
- ft_printf
- get next line
- (I'm definitely not) born to be root
- so long (and thank you for the fish)
- a large portion of my sanity
