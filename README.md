# 42
## A collection of my projects from the école 42 curriculum. Rentrée 05/2023.
After surviving the _piscine_, now the real challenge begins. Let's see how long it takes me to get through the infamous _common core_...

So far, I've said so long to:
- my libft library
- ft_printf
- get next line
- (I'm definitely not)born to be root
- so long (and thank you for the fish)
- a large portion of my sanity

Side Projects:
- weekly French literacy classes for a small charity
- English tutoring
- started teaching coding workshops for kids with Magic Makers from 09/2023
- enrolled for a year of Arabic classes (cours d'adultes, Mairie de Paris) from 09/2023
- helping subtitle my friend's adventure documentary film (FR -> EN)

Book Club:
- (forever dipping in and out of) Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez
- On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong
- Love From The Pink Palace by Jill Nalder
- Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin
