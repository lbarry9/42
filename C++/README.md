# Learning the syntax of C++ and the key concepts of object oriented programming

**And we're off to the pisicne again...**

The C++ piscine started off as sweet relief and finished a real endurance test.

After so many heavy projects in C, it was super satisfying to learn how to code in a more flexible, free (ciao norminette :wave:) and efficient way. Hopefully I'll never again have to loop round every character to allocate memory. The headlines are: classes, inheritence, pure virtual functions and abstract classes, exceptions, try-catch, switch-case, templates and containers, with a sprinkling of pointers, references, maths and algorithms.

The downside was the fatigue that comes with a grand total of 21 evaluations in order to pass the piscine (meaning also evaluating a further 21 people to earn sufficient correction points). Also, there are discrepencies between many of the subjects and correction sheets, as well as unexpected surprises during the evaluations, such as complicated test mains and unexpected requirements not noted in the subjects. 42 could save us a lot of time and frustration by updating and homogenising the C++ subjects and correction sheets. Oh and pedago team, if ever you read this, please please please update the painfully outdated, condescending and ineficient C++ intra videos if you're going to insist on us watching them all :pray:
